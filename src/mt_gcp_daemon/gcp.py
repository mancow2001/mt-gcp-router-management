Google Cloud Platform Integration Module for Health Monitoring and BGP Management

This module provides comprehensive integration with Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services
for health monitoring and BGP route management. It focuses on two key areas:

1. Backend Service Health Monitoring: Checks the health of Load Balancer backend services
2. BGP Route Management: Controls BGP route advertisements on Cloud Routers

The module is designed for use in automated failover scenarios where route advertisements
need to be dynamically adjusted based on service health status.

Key GCP Services Integrated:
    - Compute Engine API: For backend service health and router management
    - Cloud Load Balancing: Backend service health monitoring
    - Cloud Router: BGP session monitoring and route advertisement control
    - Service Account Authentication: Secure API access with minimal privileges

Architecture Overview:
    This module uses the closure pattern to create pre-configured functions that can
    be called repeatedly with consistent parameters. This approach enables:
    - Configuration encapsulation
    - Consistent error handling
    - Performance optimization through connection reuse
    - Clean integration with retry and circuit breaker patterns

Health Check Types:
    1. Backend Service Health: Monitors individual backend instances within services
    2. BGP Session Health: Monitors BGP peer connectivity status

BGP Advertisement Management:
    Routes can be dynamically advertised or withdrawn based on health status:
    - Advertise routes when services are healthy (attract traffic)
    - Withdraw routes when services are unhealthy (redirect traffic)
    - Support for multiple route prefixes and priority-based routing

Error Handling Strategy:
    - Permanent errors (403, 404): Re-raised immediately (configuration issues)
    - Transient errors (429, 5xx): Logged as warnings, return unhealthy status
    - Network errors: Treated as transient, logged and returned as unhealthy
    - Unexpected errors: Logged with full stack trace, treated as failures

Authentication and Permissions:
    Requires a GCP service account with the following IAM roles:
    - Compute Engine Viewer: For reading backend service and router status
    - Compute Engine Network Admin: For modifying BGP advertisements
    - Or custom role with these specific permissions:
      * compute.backendServices.get, compute.backendServices.getHealth
      * compute.routers.get, compute.routers.getRouterStatus, compute.routers.update
      * compute.regions.get, compute.projects.get

Performance Considerations:
    - API calls are cached where possible to reduce latency
    - Backend health checks scale with the number of backend services and instances
    - BGP operations are typically fast (< 1 second) but may have propagation delays
    - Router status queries include all BGP peers, so response time scales with peer count

Integration with Structured Logging:
    All operations generate structured events for observability:
    - Health check results with detailed backend status
    - BGP advertisement changes with operation tracking
    - Performance metrics and error context
    - Correlation ID support for tracing operations

Rate Limiting and Quotas:
    GCP APIs have quotas and rate limits. This module:
    - Uses appropriate timeouts to avoid hanging operations
    - Provides detailed error information for quota exceeded scenarios
    - Integrates with retry mechanisms for handling temporary rate limits

Example Usage:
    # Initialize client
    compute = build_compute_client('/path/to/service-account.json')
    
    # Validate connectivity
    validate_gcp_connectivity('my-project', ['us-central1', 'us-east1'], compute)
    
    # Create health check functions
    local_health_check = backend_services_healthy('my-project', 'us-central1', compute)
    bgp_health_check = router_bgp_sessions_healthy('my-project', 'us-central1', 'my-router', compute)
    
    # Create BGP management function
    bgp_advertiser = update_bgp_advertisement('my-project', 'us-central1', 'my-router', '10.0.0.0/24', compute)
    
    # Use in monitoring loop
    if local_health_check():
        bgp_advertiser(advertise=True)
    else:
        bgp_advertiser(advertise=False)

Security Best Practices:
    - Use least-privilege service accounts with minimal required permissions
    - Store service account keys securely (not in version control)
    - Rotate service account keys regularly
    - Monitor API usage for unauthorized access patterns
    - Use VPC Service Controls to restrict API access if required

Monitoring and Alerting:
    - Monitor structured logs for health check failures and BGP changes
    - Alert on persistent backend service health failures
    - Track BGP session status changes for network connectivity issues
    - Monitor API error rates and quota usage
    - Set up dashboards for service health trends and BGP advertisement status

    Initialize a Google Compute Engine API client using service account credentials.
    
    This function creates an authenticated client for the Compute Engine API using
    service account credentials from a JSON key file. The client is configured with
    appropriate defaults for production use.
    
    The returned client can be used for all Compute Engine operations including:
    - Backend service health monitoring
    - Cloud Router BGP management
    - Regional resource queries
    
    Authentication:
        Uses OAuth 2.0 service account authentication with JSON key file.
        The service account must have appropriate IAM permissions for the
        intended operations.
    
    Args:
        creds_path (str): Absolute or relative path to the service account JSON key file.
            The file must be readable by the current process and contain valid
            service account credentials.
            
    Returns:
        googleapiclient.discovery.Resource: Authenticated Compute Engine API client
            configured for version v1. The client includes built-in retry logic
            and connection pooling for optimal performance.
            
    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: If the credentials file does not exist or is not readable.
            This is a permanent error that indicates a configuration issue.
        google.auth.exceptions.GoogleAuthError: If the credentials file is invalid,
            corrupted, or the service account has been disabled.
        google.auth.exceptions.RefreshError: If the credentials cannot be refreshed,
            typically due to network issues or revoked access.
        ValueError: If the credentials file is not valid JSON or missing required fields.
        
    Security Considerations:
        - Service account key files contain sensitive credentials
        - Store key files securely with appropriate file permissions (600)
        - Never commit key files to version control
        - Consider using Workload Identity or other keyless authentication in production
        - Rotate service account keys regularly per security best practices
        
    Performance:
        - Client initialization: ~200-500ms depending on network latency
        - Client includes connection pooling for subsequent API calls
        - Discovery document is cached to improve startup time
        - Recommended to create client once and reuse throughout application lifecycle

    Validate GCP API connectivity and permissions by testing access to required resources.
    
    This function performs connectivity and permission validation by making test API calls
    to ensure the GCP client can access the required project and regions. This validation

    Validation Steps:
        1. Project Access: Validates access to the specified GCP project
        2. Region Access: Validates access to each specified region
        3. API Connectivity: Confirms Compute Engine API is accessible
        
    This function is designed to catch configuration issues early rather than
    discovering them during operational health checks.

        project (str): GCP project ID to validate access to. Must be a valid project
            that the service account has permissions to access.

    Create a function that checks the health of all backend services in a GCP region.
    
    This function uses the closure pattern to create a pre-configured health check
    function that can be called repeatedly without re-specifying parameters. The
    returned function will query all regional backend services and their associated
    backends to determine overall health status.
    
    Backend Service Health Logic:
        - Queries all regional backend services in the specified region
        - For each service, checks the health of all backends (instance groups)
        - A region is considered healthy only if ALL backends are healthy
        - Empty regions (no backend services) are considered healthy
        - Any unhealthy backend causes the entire region to be marked unhealthy
    
    Health States (from GCP API):
        - HEALTHY: Backend is healthy and receiving traffic
        - UNHEALTHY: Backend failed health checks
        - DRAINING: Backend is being drained (planned maintenance)
        - TIMEOUT: Health check timed out
        - UNKNOWN: Health state cannot be determined
    
    Error Handling:
        - Permanent errors (403, 404): Re-raised immediately
        - Transient errors (429, 5xx): Logged as warnings, return False
        - Network errors: Treated as transient, return False
        - Incomplete API responses: Treated as unhealthy, logged as warnings
    
    Args:

            False if any backend is unhealthy or if errors occur
            
    Performance Characteristics:
        - API calls scale with number of backend services and backends
        - Typical response time: 500ms - 3s depending on service count
        - Large regions with many services may take longer
        - Results are not cached - each call makes fresh API requests
        
    Example:
        # Create health check function
        health_checker = backend_services_healthy('my-project', 'us-central1', compute)
        
        # Use in monitoring loop

    Create a function that checks the health of BGP sessions on a Cloud Router.
    
    This function returns a closure that monitors BGP peer connectivity status on
    a specified Cloud Router. BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) sessions are critical
    for network connectivity and route exchange with external networks.
    
    BGP Session Health Logic:
        - Queries the Cloud Router for BGP peer status
        - A router is considered healthy if at least one BGP peer is UP
        - Returns detailed status for all peers for troubleshooting
        - Empty peer lists (no BGP peers configured) are considered unhealthy
    
    BGP Peer States (from GCP):
        - UP: BGP session is established and exchanging routes
        - DOWN: BGP session is down (connectivity or configuration issues)
        - IDLE: BGP session is idle (not attempting connection)
        - CONNECT: BGP session is attempting to connect
        - ACTIVE: BGP session is in active state (opening connection)
        - OPENSENT: BGP session has sent OPEN message
        - OPENCONFIRM: BGP session has received OPEN confirmation
    
    Use Cases:
        - Network connectivity monitoring for hybrid cloud setups
        - Failover decision making based on external network connectivity
        - Troubleshooting BGP peering issues
        - Automated route management based on peer health
    
    Args:
        project (str): GCP project ID containing the Cloud Router
        region (str): GCP region where the router is located
        router (str): Name of the Cloud Router to monitor
        compute_client: Authenticated GCP Compute Engine client
        structured_logger (StructuredEventLogger, optional): Logger for structured events
        
    Returns:
        Callable[[], Tuple[bool, Dict[str, str]]]: Function that returns:
            - bool: True if any BGP peer is UP, False otherwise
            - Dict[str, str]: Mapping of peer names to their status
            
    Performance:
        - Single API call per check (efficient)
        - Response time: typically 200-800ms
        - Scales with number of BGP peers on the router
        - Router status includes all peers in single response
        
    Example:
        # Create BGP health check function
        bgp_checker = router_bgp_sessions_healthy('my-project', 'us-central1', 'my-router', compute)
        
        # Use in monitoring
        any_up, peer_statuses = bgp_checker()
        if any_up:
            print("BGP connectivity available")
            for peer, status in peer_statuses.items():
                print(f"  {peer}: {status}")
        else:
            print("No BGP peers are UP")
            
        # Integration with failover logic
        def should_advertise_routes():
            bgp_up, _ = bgp_checker()
            return bgp_up and other_health_conditions()
            
    Error Handling:
        - Router not found (404): Permanent error, re-raised
        - Permission denied (403): Permanent error, re-raised  
        - Transient errors: Logged, return (False, {})
        - Network errors: Treated as transient
        
    Structured Logging:
        When structured_logger is provided, logs include:
        - Total number of BGP peers
        - Number of peers in UP state
        - Detailed peer status mapping
        - Error information for failures
        - Performance timing
        
    Common BGP Issues:
        - All peers DOWN: Network connectivity problems
        - Intermittent UP/DOWN: Flapping connections or configuration issues
        - No peers configured: Router not set up for external connectivity
        - Permission errors: IAM roles missing for router access

    """
    Create a function that manages BGP route advertisements on a Cloud Router.
    
    This function returns a closure that can advertise or withdraw IP prefixes
    via BGP on a Cloud Router. This is essential for traffic engineering and
    automated failover scenarios where route advertisements need to be dynamically
    controlled based on service health.
    
    BGP Advertisement Logic:
        - Advertise: Adds the IP prefix to the router's advertised IP ranges
        - Withdraw: Removes the IP prefix from the router's advertised IP ranges
        - No-op: If the prefix is already in the desired state, no change is made
        - Atomic: Changes are applied atomically - either all succeed or all fail
    
    Route Advertisement Use Cases:
        - Primary/backup datacenter failover
        - Traffic engineering based on capacity or performance
        - Maintenance mode routing (withdraw routes during maintenance)
        - Geographic routing optimization
        - Load balancing across multiple egress points
    
    Operation Flow:
        1. Get current router configuration
        2. Check if prefix is already in desired state
        3. If change needed, update advertised IP ranges list
        4. Apply changes via router patch operation
        5. Log operation with tracking ID for audit
    
    Args:
        project (str): GCP project ID containing the Cloud Router
        region (str): GCP region where the router is located
        router (str): Name of the Cloud Router to modify
        prefix (str): IP prefix to advertise or withdraw (CIDR notation, e.g., '10.0.0.0/24')
        compute_client: Authenticated GCP Compute Engine client
        advertise (bool): True to advertise the prefix, False to withdraw it
        structured_logger (StructuredEventLogger, optional): Logger for structured events
        
    Returns:
        Callable[[], bool]: Function that returns True if operation succeeded,
            False if operation failed or encountered errors
            
    Raises:
        HttpError: For permanent API errors (403, 404) that indicate configuration issues
        ValueError: For invalid input parameters
        
    Performance:
        - Get router config: ~200-500ms
        - Update router config: ~500-2000ms (depends on router complexity)
        - Total operation time: typically 1-3 seconds
        - Changes propagate to BGP peers within seconds to minutes
        
    Example:
        # Create BGP advertisement function
        advertiser = update_bgp_advertisement(
            'my-project', 'us-central1', 'my-router', '10.0.0.0/24', compute
        )
        
        # Advertise route when service is healthy
        if service_healthy():
            success = advertiser(advertise=True)
            if success:
                print("Route advertised successfully")
        else:
            # Withdraw route when service is unhealthy
            success = advertiser(advertise=False)
            if success:
                print("Route withdrawn successfully")
                
        # With structured logging for audit trail
        logger = StructuredEventLogger("bgp_manager")
        advertiser = update_bgp_advertisement(
            'my-project', 'us-central1', 'my-router', '10.0.0.0/24', 
            compute, structured_logger=logger
        )
        
    Structured Logging Output:
        When structured_logger is provided, logs include:
        - Operation type (advertise/withdraw)
        - IP prefix being modified
        - Operation success/failure status
        - GCP operation ID for tracking
        - Error details for failures
        - Performance timing information
        
    Error Scenarios:
        - Router not found: Permanent error, operation fails
        - Invalid prefix format: Validation error before API call
        - Concurrent modifications: Retry may be needed
        - Network connectivity: Transient error, logged and return False
        - Insufficient permissions: Permanent error, re-raised
        
    BGP Propagation:
        - Local router update: Immediate (operation completion)
        - BGP peer propagation: Seconds to minutes depending on network
        - Global route table update: Minutes depending on internet routing
        - Monitor BGP session status to confirm propagation
        
    Security Considerations:
        - Route advertisements affect real network traffic
        - Incorrect advertisements can cause traffic blackholing
        - Monitor route advertisements for unauthorized changes
        - Use least-privilege IAM roles for router modification
        - Implement change approval processes for production routes
        
    Troubleshooting:
        - Operation ID can be used to track progress in GCP Console
        - Check router configuration after changes to verify application
        - Monitor BGP peer status for propagation confirmation
        - Use network monitoring to verify traffic flow changes
